It’s usually fully permissionless and is typically used to govern broad decentralized protocols and/or tokens themselves.","daos-5-b-label":"Share-based membership","daos-5-b-explanation":"Share-based DAOs are more permissioned but still quite open. Any prospective member can submit a proposal to join the DAO, usually offering a tribute of some value in the form of tokens or work.","daos-5-c-label":"Reputation-based membership","daos-5-c-explanation":"Unlike token or share-based membership, reputation-based DAOs don't transfer ownership to contributors. DAO members must earn reputation through participation.","daos-5-d-label":"Executive board and offchain treasury management","daos-5-d-explanation":"This approach uses highly centralized and opaque mechanisms of governing. On the contrary, DAOs use verifiable voting mechanisms and onchain treasury management to ensure transparency and accountability.","staking-solo-1-prompt":"Which is true about slashing?","staking-solo-1-a-label":"Penalty for being offline, rewards resume when back online","staking-solo-1-a-explanation":"Being offline does NOT result in slashing. Small penalties are incurred for being offline, and rewards resume when the validator returns online and resumes attestations.","staking-solo-1-b-label":"Penalty for being offline, validator is immediately prohibited from attesting ever again","staking-solo-1-b-explanation":"Being offline does NOT result in slashing. While slashing will result in the validator being prohibited from ever attesting again and is ultimately forcefully ejected, being offline will NOT result in ejection from the network.","staking-solo-1-c-label":"Penalty for breaking specific consensus rules, rewards resume after slashing","staking-solo-1-c-explanation":"Slashing is a serious penalty for breaking specific consensus rules that present a threat to the network. As such, once a validator is slashed they are immediately prohibited from attesting any further, and are ultimately forcefully ejected from the network and remaining ETH is withdrawn to the owner.","staking-solo-1-d-label":"Penalty for breaking specific consensus rules, validator is immediately prohibited from attesting ever again","staking-solo-1-d-explanation":"Slashing is a serious penalty for breaking specific consensus rules that present a threat to the network.

The size of these penalties is approximately equal to 75% of what the reward for a proper attestation would have been. Rewards resume when validator goes back online, and NO slashing occurs.","staking-solo-2-b-label":"Inactivity penalties are incurred only while unavailable","staking-solo-2-b-explanation":"While unavailable, a validator will incur small inactivity penalties, approximately equal to 75% of what the reward would have been for a proper attestation. In rare/extreme cases where the network is not finalizing (i.e. over 1/3 of the network is also offline), these penalties are significantly greater. Rewards resume when validator goes back online, and no slashing occurs.","staking-solo-2-c-label":"Immediate slashing and removal from the network","staking-solo-2-c-explanation":"This is a common misconception, but going offline does NOT result in slashing! Slashing is a specific type of penalty for more serious offense, with larger penalties and also results in removal from the validator set.","staking-solo-2-d-label":"One week delay before slashing and ejection","staking-solo-2-d-explanation":"Being offline does NOT result in slashing, even after extended period of time. A validator could theoretically be offline for years without being slashed, though inactivity penalties would mount if the validator does not exit.","staking-solo-3-prompt":"What is the max effective balance of a validator?","staking-solo-3-a-label":"16","staking-solo-3-a-explanation":"Validators who drop to an effective balance of 16 ETH are automatically exited from the Beacon Chain.","staking-solo-3-b-label":"32","staking-solo-3-b-explanation":"32 ETH is both the minimum ETH required to activate a new validator, and also the maximum 'effective balance' (vote weight) for that validator. Rewards above 32 can be accrued, but this balance does not contribute to the weight of that validators vote on the network and rewards are not increased.","staking-solo-3-c-label":"Variable depending on the operator","staking-solo-3-c-explanation":"The rules of consensus apply to every validator account equally and are not dependent upon the individual operating the node. The max effective balance of all validators is 32 ETH.","staking-solo-3-d-label":"No limit","staking-solo-3-d-explanation":"Each validator account is limited to an effective balance of 32 ETH, limiting the overall power of any single validator on the network. This also limits how much ETH can be staked or un-staked in a given time period, as validator activations and exits are processed through a rate-limited queue.","staking-solo-4-prompt":"Which is NOT a reward received as a validator?","staking-solo-4-a-label":"Block reward","staking-solo-4-a-explanation":"Validators receive rewards in the form of new ETH issuance for proposing a valid block when randomly selected by the protocol.

This means for a given time period, being offline 50% of that time will still be net profitable, albeit less profitable than a more reliably available validator.","staking-solo-5-d-label":"~25%","staking-solo-5-d-explanation":"A validator with only 25% uptime will be incurring penalties for the other 75% of the time. Given the similar size of rewards and penalties, being offline for 3x the amount of time online will result in a net loss of ETH for that time period.","staking-solo-6-prompt":"Which of the following is NOT a slashable offense?","staking-solo-6-a-label":"Being offline","staking-solo-6-a-explanation":"Simply being offline does not result in slashing. It will result in small inactivity penalties while offline, but will resume attesting when back online.","staking-solo-6-b-label":"Proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot","staking-solo-6-b-explanation":"This threatens the integrity of the network and will result in slashing and ejection from the network.","staking-solo-6-c-label":"Attesting to a block that 'surrounds' another one (effectively changing history)","staking-solo-6-d-label":"'Double voting' by attesting to two candidates for the same block","staking-solo-7-prompt":"Which is NOT a way to protect/prevent your validator from being slashed?","staking-solo-7-a-label":"Avoid overly redundant setups, and only store your keys with one validator client at a time","staking-solo-7-a-explanation":"The majority of slashing to date are from operators storing their signing keys on more than one machine, as a redundant backup. This is highly risky, as any malfunction can result in double voting and slashing.","staking-solo-7-b-label":"Run client software as-is without altering the code yourself","staking-solo-7-b-explanation":"Client software is written and tested to protect against performing slashable actions. To execute a slashable action, this would typically require altering the client code yourself in a malicious manner.","staking-solo-7-c-label":"Run a client that is being used by the majority of other validators","staking-solo-7-c-explanation":"Using the same client as a majority of the rest of the network puts you at risk for being slashed in the event of a software bug in that client. Running a minority client protects against this.","staking-solo-7-d-label":"Disable validator for 2-4 epochs before migrating keys to a new machine","staking-solo-7-d-explanation":"This allows time to allow the chain to finalize while your node is offline, to minimize any risk of accidental double voting and slashing during key migration.","staking-solo-8-prompt":"Which is NOT required to receive reward payments / partial withdrawals?","staking-solo-8-a-label":"Providing an execution withdrawal address one time","staking-solo-8-a-explanation":"This is required once for the withdrawal process to know where to send any consensus layer funds to","staking-solo-8-b-label":"Having an effective balance of 32 ETH","staking-solo-8-b-explanation":"Your effective balance must be maxed out at 32 ETH before any partial withdrawals will trigger.","staking-solo-8-c-label":"Having a total balance over 32 ETH","staking-solo-8-c-explanation":"Your total balance must have rewards above 32 ETH for any partial withdrawals to trigger.","staking-solo-8-d-label":"Submitting requested withdrawal amount with gas payment","staking-solo-8-d-explanation":"Once the other criteria are met, reward payments are automatic.
